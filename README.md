## Getting Started

### What Is React?
**JavaScript library** for web and native *UI*

### Why Not Just JavaScript (Vanilla)?
- Cumbersome (complex, large, inefficient)
- Error-prone potential (for complex code)
- Huge pain

### Why Use React?
- Extremely **popular**
- **Strong ecosystem** -> Rich libraries, tools, and community support (e.g., Redux, React Router, Next.js)
- From building complex, interactive UI to **breeze**
- **Declarative** UI programming -> Define the goal, not steps -> Describe what the UI should look like, and React handles updates efficiently
- **Component-based** â€“> UIs are built from small, reusable pieces, making code easier to manage and scale
- **Virtual DOM** â€“> React updates the UI quickly and efficiently by minimizing direct DOM manipulations
- **One-way data flow** â€“> Predictable data flow makes debugging and understanding state changes easier
- **Reusable logic** via hooks â€“> Logic like fetching data or handling state can be reused cleanly across components
- **Cross-platform support** â€“> You can use **React Native** to build mobile apps using the same concepts

### Creating React Projects
ðŸ§ª Two Ways to Set Up a React Project:
- Quick Start with **CodeSandbox** (react.new):
  - Visit **react.new** to instantly create a new React project in your browser using CodeSandbox.
  - **No local installation needed** â€” ideal for beginners or if you can't install software (e.g., on a company computer).
  - Used throughout the course for hands-on practice.
  - CodeSandbox includes a file editor and live preview in one browser window.
- **Local** React Project Setup:
  - Recommended for **more control, performance, and use of tools** like Visual Studio Code.
  - Requires **Node.js** installed from nodejs.org.
  - Two common tools to set up a project:
    - **Vite** (recommended, modern, fast)
    - **Create React App** (older, still common)
  - Example setup with **Vite**:
    - Run: **npm create vite@latest project-name**
    - Choose "React"
    - Install dependencies with: npm install
    - Start dev server with: npm run dev
  - Example setup with Create React App:
    - Run: **npx create-react-app project-name**
> This setup provides a local development server that auto-updates the preview when you save changes.

### Why We Need Tools Like Vite or CodeSandbox for React
You can't just use a plain HTML and JS file to write React code because:
- React uses **JSX** â€“ a **special syntax** that looks like HTML in JavaScript.
- Browsers don't understand JSX, so the code **must be transformed** first.
- Build tools like **Vite** are needed to:
  - **Convert JSX** into browser-compatible JavaScript.
  - **Optimize** the code (e.g., minify, remove whitespace, shorten names) for better performance.
- Tools like CodeSandbox and Vite **automate** all of this:
  - They make **setup easy**.
  - CodeSandbox needs **no installation**.
  - Vite gives you **fast local development**.
