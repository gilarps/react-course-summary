## Getting Started
### What is React?
**JavaScript library** for web and native *UI*
### Why not just JavaScript (vanilla)?
- Cumbersome (complex, large, inefficient)
- Error-prone potential (for complex code)
- Huge pain
### Why use React?
- Extremely **popular**
- **Strong ecosystem** -> Rich libraries, tools, and community support (e.g., Redux, React Router, Next.js)
- From building complex, interactive UI to **breeze**
- **Declarative** UI programming -> Define the goal, not steps -> Describe what the UI should look like, and React handles updates efficiently
- **Component-based** –> UIs are built from small, reusable pieces, making code easier to manage and scale
- **Virtual DOM** –> React updates the UI quickly and efficiently by minimizing direct DOM manipulations
- **One-way data flow** –> Predictable data flow makes debugging and understanding state changes easier
- **Reusable logic** via hooks –> Logic like fetching data or handling state can be reused cleanly across components
- **Cross-platform support** –> You can use **React Native** to build mobile apps using the same concepts
